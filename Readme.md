# Nucleus OS App

## Getting Started

First you will have to download and bootstrap the OS directory.
It's best to clone it in to the same parent directory as this project.

[ ] TODO: show example of `ls` output

```
git clone https://github.com/jaredwolff/nucelus-os.git
```

Then you can set up a symbolic link to the OS

```
ln -s ../nucelus-os/ .
```

Using the provided `Makefile`, you can now flash, debug and more.
